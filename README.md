# Productivity-Enhancer

The key to hitting targets and achieving goals every day is
to enhance your productivity, however there are such countless distractions nowadays that this turns out to be progressively difficult to do.
With such a lot of inclusion of events and distractions, every day and the steady trickle feed of content through social media intruding on our work, we as a whole need a little assistance to remain on track and chipping away at each undertaking in turn.
 We might all want to build our efficiency at work or somewhere else during the day, particularly in the midst of the relative multitude of present-day distractions, and it is one puzzle many people have been trying to solve.
Our application will be be designed in a such a way that acts like a tracker to record the way we spend our time.
 Our app will also block away all the notifications from different social media apps, to remove temptation even when we would like to be tempted, hence increasing the userâ€™s productivity.
 Plus, the To-do list makes adding tasks quick and simple
 It only takes a few clicks and entries. This will help the user make
 a check on her/his progress without missing out anything.
 This app will be designed in every possible way to help out the
 user increase their productivity and efficiency throughout the day.
